// In binary tree, it doesnt matter what is on left and right
// but in binary search tree, the left nodes should be less than the parent
// the right nodes should be greater than the parent
// all the subtrees must itself be a BST
// ideally duplicates are not allowed in BST 
// however to integrate duplicates, we can either put them on the left or on the right making an equality condition
// The height of a BST is generally kept as logn 
// This is done so that searching can be done easily and in good time
