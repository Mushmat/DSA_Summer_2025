// Trees follow heirarchical DS
// A binary tree says that inside a node, there can at max be two nodes
// Binary: 0 or 1
// the starting of the tree is called root
// the next nodes attached to the root are called children
// the last nodes (who have no children) are called leaf nodes
// a part of a tree is called subtree (leaf included)

// Types of Binary Trees:
// 1) Full BT: Every node either has 0 or 2 children
// 2) Complete BT: All levels should be completely filled except the last level. and the last level has all nodes on left as possible
// 3) Perfect BT: All leaf nodes are at the same level
// 4) Balanced BT: Height of tree is max log(n) having n as the number of nodes
// 5) Degenerate Tree: A skew tree (type of linked list) (in a straight line) (every node has a single child)
