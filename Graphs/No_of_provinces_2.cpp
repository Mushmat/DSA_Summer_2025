// same question
// number of connected components

// given a graph, represented by adj matrix
// here, we solve this using disjoint set
// make the disjoint set for the given graph
// the number of ultimate parents are the number of connected componentns
// therefore if(findUPar(u) == u) answer++
// and answer is the answer
