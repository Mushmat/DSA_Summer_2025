//All patterns are based on loops
//Patterns help master loops.
//Patterns are not asked in interviews but play a crucial role in learning.
//Most of the patterns are made using two loops: The Outer Loop and The Inner Loop

    //The Outer Loop is specifically for the number of lines 
    //The Inner Loop is specifically for the columns
    //Rule 1: For outer loop, count the number of rows/lines
    //Rule 2: For inner loop, focus on the columns and connect them somehow on the rows. 
    //Rule 3: Whatever you are printing, print them inside the inner for loop.
    //Rule 4: Observe symmetry (optional; only applicable for certain patterns)
