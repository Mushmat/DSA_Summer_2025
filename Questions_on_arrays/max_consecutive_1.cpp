// Given an array of 0s and 1s
// Return the number of consecutive 1s in the array
// Initialize counter as 0, ans as 0
// Start iterating, encounter 1, increase counter. encounter 0, store count as and, and reset count to 0
// continue iterating, encounter 1, increase counter, encounter 0, store count as ans only if count > ans
// Simple one iteration O(n) time
